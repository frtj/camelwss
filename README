This is a websocket "hello world" example with apache camel(2.10) server side and Dojo Toolkit (1.7.3) on client side.

Basicly just download
mvn jetty:run
Open http://localhost:12000/camelwss/ in Chrome. 

Firefox might work. IE6/7/8/9 Absolutely does not work. Opera 12.01 might work, but you have to manually enable websocket.
